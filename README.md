# ShortBot
ShortBot is an url shortened link generator. According to statements by Google's Matt Cutts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMkltd6dZzU), URL shorteners do not negatively affect Search Engine Optimization. Therefore, ShortBot generates shortened links for your URLs that you provide and plans are in place for getting Google to index your shortened links.
